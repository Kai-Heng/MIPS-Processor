# MIPS-Processor
This project entails the design and implementation of a single-cycle, a software-approach pipeline and a hardware-approach pipeline MIPS processor using primarily structural VHDL, incorporating knowledge gained from the labs, lectures, and homework assignments. The project milestones include high-level design drafting, submodule design, and eventual integration of the processor capable of executing various MIPS instructions such as add, and, lw, sw, beq, j, and more. By designing software and hardware pipeline approaches, the project aims to analyze the performance of each processor.
